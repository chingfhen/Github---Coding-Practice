# Github---Coding-Practice

These codes are fully written by myself. 

I enjoy coding python and it has been my main coding language for over 5 years. 

My principles when coding:

1. Keep it simple - sometimes they are out of the box solutions. 
2. Optimize memory and efficiency - this can make use of in-built functions like map() or relevant structures like sets or dictionaries
3. Keep it short - though not always the case, short solutions are usually most concise and fast
